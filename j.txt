In the stillness of a morning bright,
Ideas awaken, taking flight.
One small thought, like a whispered breeze,
Can stir the mind and put it at ease.

So whether it's a word or rhyme,
Or thoughts that drift beyond their time—
Write them down, don’t let them fade,
That’s how the strongest dreams are made.
