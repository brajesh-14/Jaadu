In a village lost to time and mist,
Where moonlight danced and stars would twist,
Lived an old man with a wooden cane,
Who wandered nightly, through wind and rain.

They called him Keeper of the Light,
For every dusk, till break of night,
He lit a lantern, gold and small,
And walked the borders of the wall.
